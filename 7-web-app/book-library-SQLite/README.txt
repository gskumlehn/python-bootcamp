WebApp Project

This project uses Flask and Bootstrap to create a library of Book, with title, author and rating

The home page shows the list of book, which can be added by an WTForm

Once added, the books can be deleted and the rating can be edited

The books data is kept in an SQLite database, and any SQL commands are performed by the SQLAlchemy ORM
